# INSE-6180

This is project 6180 where we are working with process mining techniques more importantly alpha miner and petri nets. 
alpha miner is a process mining technique to represent event logs visually in what we call petri nets. 
In our project, the intent was to explore process mining techniques, more specifically the alpha miner and visually representing processes using petri nets. Our approach is divided into two parts. 
First, is to check if the petri net formed is wholly representing the event log and if not, to detect where the differences lie. 
Second, using the petri nets to compare two event logs and visually showcasing their differences as well as similarities through diverging colors and labels.
